# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Emmanuel Gonzalez
## About
I earned my Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University - East Bay in May 2021.
I focused more on data structures, web development, and databases while doing my curriculum. Since graduating, I've grown even more 
interests in Web Dev, Machine Learning, and AI.

## Projects

  ### 1 
  #### This project focused on API calls from client side. It served as a means of getting comfortable with JSON data and managing network calls.

  - [repository](https://github.com/manny2384/weather)
    
  ### 2 
  #### My planets project is composed of learning functional components in REACT and using a JSON data file to serve each component depending on the planet name( state )

  ### 3
  #### This project was 1 of the challenges I took from FrontEndMentor. The goal was the recreate the loopstudios landing page as close as possible by making judgements based off the design. The secondary goal was to make it a responsive design for both mobile and desktops.

## Interests
### ðŸŒ± As I said before, lately I've been interested in learning about Machine Learning and since I didn't get the chance to learn at while in school, I've been taking online courses to learn at my own pace. Currently I have a few projects I built apart from course excercise

#### This project implements multivariate regression. The goal of the project was to implement the algorithm from scratch by programming the functions for gradient descent, cost function, and vectorizing the computations to increase speed.

 #### This project was built after learning how games such as tic tac toe define a move via minimax decision making.
  - [AI Game](https://manny2384.github.io/manny2384games.github.io/)

 #### Implementation of BFS to find solutions for the Cannibal and Missionary problem
